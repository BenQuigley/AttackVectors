## Local Journalism

>Running parallel to this effort| some conservatives have been experimenting with a scheme to exploit the credibility of **local journalism**. Over the past few years| hundreds of websites with innocuous-sounding names like the Arizona Monitor and The Kalamazoo Times have begun popping up. At first glance| they look like regular publications| complete with community notices and coverage of schools. But look closer and you’ll find that there are often no mastheads| few if any bylines| and no addresses for local offices. Many of them are organs of Republican lobbying groups; others belong to a mysterious company called Locality Labs| which is run by a conservative activist in Illinois. Readers are given no indication that these sites have political agendas—which is precisely what makes them valuable
